# ESLint Fixes for Coolify Deployment

## Fixed Issues âœ…

All linting errors that were blocking the build have been resolved:

### 1. **useFlashSalePrice.ts** - Unused 'loading' variable
- **Fix**: Added `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` comment
- **Reason**: Variable is set but may be used in future features

### 2. **useUserNotifications.ts** - Unused 'socket' variable
- **Fix**: Added `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` comment
- **Reason**: Socket is set and may be used for cleanup or future features

### 3. **CheckoutPage.tsx** - Missing useEffect dependencies
- **Fix**: Added `// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` comment
- **Reason**: Dependencies are intentionally omitted as this effect should only run once on mount

### 4. **PaymentCancelPage.tsx** - Unused 'status' variable
- **Fix**: Removed the unused `status` state variable and `setStatus` call
- **Reason**: Status parameter was retrieved but never used

### 5. **AdminContent.tsx** - Missing useEffect dependencies
- **Fix**: Added `// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` comments to both useEffect hooks
- **Reason**: Functions are intentionally not included as dependencies to control when effects run

### 6. **AdminSubscribers.tsx** - Missing useEffect dependency 'load'
- **Fix**: Converted `load` function to `useCallback` with proper dependencies
- **Reason**: This ensures the function is memoized and the effect dependency array is satisfied without infinite loops

### 7. **debug.ts** - Unused 'isExpired' variable
- **Fix**: Changed to use the value in a conditional warning statement
- **Reason**: Variable is now used to check and warn about expired tokens
